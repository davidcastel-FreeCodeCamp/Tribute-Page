# FreeCodeCamp - Tribute-Page Project

This is my project for FreeCodeCamp :computer:

<p>
  The lesson was called <em>"Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Tribute Page"</em>.
  The purpose of the project was to create a project that will pay tribute to someone or something. I chose to make a tribute to the famous painting <em>"Starry Night"</em> by Vincent Van Gouh.
	<br>
	The site is small and meant to fulfill the requirements of the project.
